KitchenSink mod
-This is the big one, one where I'll be adding in new Crops, Craftables, Recipes and Mechanics

ChozoStyle mod
-Basically changing sprites in Stardew Valley to be more like Metroid Fusion
	-Slimes could be little baby Metroids
	-Life Elixir could be Energy Tanks
	-Small bombs would be Small bombs (from Metroid)
	-Big bombs would be Power Bombs
	-Water would be retextured (might destroy everything, keep as a 	maybe)
	-Ditto for Lava
	-Flies would be Menu (from Metroid Fusion)
	-Message box retextured to be like Metroid Fusion's
	-The Slime stuff in Crobus's place would be the Beta Acid from 		Metroid Fusion
	-Change Crobus' look to be more Chozo
	-Alternatively, changing the Slimes to be kinda like the X, or 	like those amoeba things in Section 1 of Metroid Fusion
