KitchenSink
Basically just lean into the name and have a bunch of additions to the cooking/kitchen area.

I want to add in new craftables that, when you interact with them, they help to make the new additions.

Experimentals
	-New Oils? (have to have same function as other oils or to not 		be compatible with other recipes with oil. or just keep the oil 	generic)
	-Fried Mess (Put in something that shouldn't be fried)
	-Smoothies (gives more meaning to the fruits, could also make 		the fruit bat cave more useful by proxy)
	-Fryer (Possible implementation of different types of Oil?)
